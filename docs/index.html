<ul>
<li><strong>Head of Cloud Platform</strong> @ <a href="http://www.carfinance247.co.uk">Carfinance247</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am leading the digital transformation of Carfinance 247, where our infrastructure and hosting platforms are outdated. I am using the Azure Cloud Adaption Framework to help modernize our web applications, APIs (some microservices, mostly coarse-grained RESTful services), and workers. I have a lot of experience and enthusiasm for the cloud. I have always followed a <strong>Cloud First</strong> and <strong>Serverless</strong> approach on both the Azure and AWS cloud platforms. I am passionate about cloud-native, twelve-factor apps, patterns, standards, and their benefits for the enterprise and small business. I enjoy working with cloud providers the most.</p>
<p>I have created our new platform using AKS clusters as part of the digital transformation effort. I have devised our CICD strategy to update our legacy .NET Framework, .NET Core and NodeJS workloads and to migrate them to the Azure cloud. I have done this while simplifying the process and reducing mental load. To support our new platform, I have designed and built a Hub &amp; Spoke network topology that allows us to securely access resources behind private endpoints from our corporate network, and to resolve DNS names between Azure and our on-prem DCs. I lead a small but experienced team.</p>
<p>These are the technologies and backing services that I am introducing and leading at CF247, as well as working with and managing daily:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud Architecture</li>
<li>Azure Administration (Excl AAD)</li>
<li>AKS</li>
<li>Helm</li>
<li>Azure Bicep</li>
<li>GHA Workflows</li>
<li>AzDevOps</li>
<li>Azure Compute, VMSS</li>
<li>Azure Private Endpoints, Private DNS Zones, Networking and Azure FW</li>
<li>Azure Functions, Event Hub, Event Grid (System &amp; Custom), Service Bus, Storage (inc. Queue, Table, Files), LogicApps, App Services &amp; Plans, KeyVault, App Configuration, CosmosDB, SaaS (Logz &amp; Kafka), Azure Container Registry</li>
<li>Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Advisor</li>
<li>Azure Blueprints</li>
<li>Azure Policy</li>
<li>Azure Application Insights &amp; Monitor, Alerting, Kusto QL</li>
<li>Logz.io (grafana, kibana) - researched and integrated, replacing our legacy unstable ELK stack</li>
<li>Azure Managed Identity (.NET &amp; NodeJS SDKs, System &amp; User)</li>
<li>RBAC</li>
<li>C#, .net 3.1 &amp; 6, .net framework 4.8</li>
<li>Steering MS FastTrak programmes including SQL Server AG migration</li>
<li>Cloudflare &amp; API v4 (DNS, Monitors, Pools and LBs)</li>

<p><a href="#projects">Click here to see projects worked on while at Carfinance247</a></p>
<p>Reporting directly to the DoE (Director of Engineering), I collaborate with different teams to teach, support and advise them. I also participate in the current sprint. I work on side projects and PoC (proof of concept) projects. I have given presentations on AWS &amp; Google Serverless services. I help to define HLA, enhance coding quality and engineering standards. I am a team player and assist my colleagues and CF247 operations whenever needed. I offer direction and guidance on cloud computing, cloud architecture and development. I am cloud-first, a polyglot, and a supporter of serverless technologies.</p>
<p>After doing research and implementation on several projects using the NestJS NodeJS framework, I delivered a technical talk in Manchester - meetup - on the NestJS framework, Dapr and KEDA in November 2020.</p>

<h3 id="other-positions">Other positions</h3>
<p><strong>BI contractor</strong> &amp; <strong>.NET contractor</strong></p>
<p>As a contractor in the Business Intelligence space, I have gained valuable experience working with GE Capital, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Equitas &amp; GUS.</p>
<p>After graduating from University, I pursued my interest in EIS (Executive information systems), which led me to the BI field and the world of contracting. Along the way, I developed another passion: web application development. I took on various projects and challenges to hone my skills. This enabled me to acquire a wide range of competencies and expertise to offer to employers. I have enjoyed many interesting roles, culminating in my dream job as CTO.</p>
<p>For more than 12 years, I have been a SME (subject matter expert) in the contact centre space, a skilled systems integrator, a cloud solutions architect, a proficient serverless developer, a DevOps Advocate and a trusted technical consultant for Qualtrak, working with teams of all sizes across the globe.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="where-i-see-my-passions-and-skill-set-benefiting-your-organisation">Where I see my passions, and skill set, benefiting your organisation</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I love learning new things and staying up to date with the latest technologies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can guide you and your team through the migration of enterprise solutions and web-based applications to the serverless stack (saving you time, money, and resources) or containerization [App Servces, ACA and AKS], as well as help you quickly experiment with new ideas by developing and deploying features to measure customer feedback and revenue potential</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am passionate about serverless technologies and have been using them for years. I started with Azure functions and then explored AWS, before coming back to Azure. I believe that serverless is the best way to build modern applications for many reasons, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed from idea to execution</li>
<li>Cost-effectiveness for you and your customers</li>
<li>Reusability and scalability of components and events</li>
<li>Resilience and isolation of functions</li>
<li>Reduced environmental impact and carbon footprint</li>
<li>Focus on the business logic and not the infrastructure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have hands-on experience in designing and implementing cloud architectures of various scales that ensure business continuity and scalability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have leveraged ML backend services (AWS Transcribe, AWS Comprehend) to design solutions and have built PoCs and production services using serverless technology (Azure Functions, LogicApps, Event Grid, Event Hub, AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, AWS API Gateway)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have architected and implemented a new platform that uses Kubernetes (AKS) as its core</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a strong background in AWS and certifications, but now I am fully committed to the Azure cloud platform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I keep researching and learning about the evolving world of serverless technologies. My current interest is WASM (OOB) and this has led me to learn Rust.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="my-preferred-role">My preferred role</h2>
<p>To tackle complex cloud-native (CN) architecture (Azure) chalenges and spearhead the CN design and implementation, develop cloud-centric or hybrid solutions, foster a DevSecOps culture, practices and tooling, mentor and shape communities and train teams on cloud skills, and drive innovation through the use of cloud technology.</p>

<h3 id="carfinance247-projectsactivities">Carfinance247 projects/activities:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have delivered brown bags on AWS serverless services and Google serverless options (<em>Cloud Functions &amp; Cloud Run Knative, deployed via GitHub Actions</em>)</li>
<li>I have delivered a brown bag on Microservices Architecture</li>
<li>I have delivered a Town Hall, show-casing a solution that uses Twilio Serverless Functions, Twilio Flow, GitHub Actions and other cloud-based services.  This presentation included a slide deck encompassing guiding principles, architecture, the technology used, culminated with a live demo</li>
<li>I have helped maintain enterprise Twilio CRM using angular 1.x and supporting HTTP API microservices hosted &amp; load balanced in docker Swarm</li>
<li>I worked on a Pilot project that assessed both Google and Azure Cloud services. Some of this work, especially story spikes, required pair programming</li>
<li>I have created a solution that subscribed to Azure Event Grid and Azure Service Bus (<em>topics &amp; queues</em>) and used Azure SignalR Service to update a UI hosted on AKS</li>
<li>I worked on the new Vehicles team, helped shape development principals and used Jenkins and Google services including GKE</li>
<li>I am working with the Phoenix &amp; Integration team to help maintain and add features to several .NET Core C# and UI git repositories</li>
<li>I have created equivalent EDA in AWS (<em>node.js, Serverless, SQS, SignalR, ASP.NET Core</em>) from PoC written/architected using Google services in a fraction of the time plus architected the solution to deal with edge/corner cases using architecture instead of code</li>
<li>I have created Bamboo build &amp; deployment projects, as well as Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines</li>
<li>I have created as part of the GitHub/Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, .NET Core WebApplicationFactory based functional tests that span multiple docker services</li>
<li>I researched and deployed (docker) Snyk for checking for code/library vulnerabilities, code quality and docker image scanning</li>
<li>I have participated in multiple inceptions, helped shape HLA and define requirements</li>
<li>I drew on observability experience to (a) implement/deploy Prometheus time series Db for use with (b) new Grafana dashboards (based on google&rsquo;s USE &amp; RED methods) to help monitor both infrastructure and application performance</li>
<li>I am architecting a solution that uses GitHub GraphQL to provide better visibility on repository dependencies</li>
<li>I educate, provide guidance, insight and assist colleagues across multiple teams</li>
<li>I called on load/stress testing experience to assess HTTP API demand limitations and help identify and fix defects</li>
<li>I am an active participant in sprints and a strong advocate of Agile (Scrum) &amp; XP development in general</li>
<li>I have worked on side projects and experimental work for DoE</li>
<li>I have worked on a PoC project using Azure services (<em>CosmosDB MongoDB API, Azure Functions, Event Grid, Service Bus, DevOps</em>)</li>
<li>I have architected and created a PoC, that uses Twilio Serverless, Twilio Flow, Azure Service Bus Topics, Azure CosmosDB, Azure Storage, Azure Functions all provisioned using Terraform and GitHub Actions that (1) send SMSs to applicants that prompt for answers to a list of questions and (2) providing a summary of questions and answers when the applicant sends a text with &lsquo;STATUS&rsquo;</li>
<li>I have architected, managed and developed a project that utilised Twilio Serverless Functions, Twilio Flow and Azure services to orchestrate the queuing of a transferred call to tiered agents (Twilio Workflow Routing Step), dropping the call down through tiers of agents to be answered, including those agents who weren&rsquo;t available originally.  All events uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, then to be processed by an ETL pipeline using Azure Functions and Pandas to find their eventual resting place within an Azure Data Lake for reporting purposes.</li>
