      <description> I have designed and implemented several billing mechanisms. Including designs/models orientated around licensing, another using AWS MMS (metering service) for the AWS QuickStart and more recently, one to capture product usage based on a specific frequency. The later architectured and delivered once again via serverless technology. Created web apps [some serverless] to provide visibility into usage Create application features to help mitigate restrictions on internet access Subscription models designed and developed for: per agent, per user, per period, per feature usage, per role  </description>
