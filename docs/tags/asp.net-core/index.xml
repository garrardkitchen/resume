      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Migrate Coach product away from a monolyth to being 100% serverless.  Main web platform hosted via ECS Fargate and all features, RESTul APIs be Lambda backed API Gateways and Step Functions.  Data repositories used are dynamoDB, ElasticSearch, Amazon Aurora (mySQL), Redis and S3.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coach migrated from MSSQL to MySQL as costs were too high for Always-On capabilities. I was accepted onto Aurora MySQL Preview programme and contributed to this phase.  The product had a key dependency that required a specific version of MySQL. As a result we are now using Amazon Aurora and plan to migrate over to  Aurora Serverless when version 5.7 is supported.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have researched several big data solutions but found them either too costly, lead time too lengthy or too complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coach needed something to present actionable data.  Not knowing whether the idea matched reality, I proposed a phase 1 release that would lead to feature enhancements that would naturally lead to something that would help more.  I architected an ETL and data analytics process that would generate separate JSON formatted data, persisted to S3 for a specific user after being processed by a Pandas dataframe.  Implemented using CloudWatch trigger, S3, Redis &amp;amp; lambdas and Amazon Aurora (MySQL).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Retheme Product</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Formally a front-end developer, I feel confortable and confident carrying out work in this space&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The CXcoach cloud based product needed a ‘face lift’.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I investigated the most frugal way to provide the product with a new look and feel, one that is aligned with industry expectations.  I settled on an open source theme and provided my UX lead developer a branch of code that used this new theme for him to complete and fix any style and placement issues.  For specific areas of the product (features), I provided the same person with a mock up (HTML and style) for him to incorporate into the React front-end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
