      <description>Coach has a long standing feature called IntelliSearch.
It is a feature that, at a specific time, for several set periods [daily, weekly, monthly, custom], it will submit queries to a Data Connector (conduit between our system and an external system) to match up randomly selected recordings for later evaluation. The random algorithm implemented is there to ensure fairness of recording selection so apples and apples are compared and not apples to oranges.</description>

      <description>Migrate Coach product away from a monolyth to being 100% serverless. Main web platform hosted via ECS Fargate and all features, RESTul APIs be Lambda backed API Gateways and Step Functions. Data repositories used are dynamoDB, ElasticSearch, Amazon Aurora (mySQL), Redis and S3.
  Coach migrated from MSSQL to MySQL as costs were too high for Always-On capabilities. I was accepted onto Aurora MySQL Preview programme and contributed to this phase.</description>

      <description>Investigated ways to reduce time to market, end-client license costs, hosting costs and development costs.
This research and later development efforts contributed to formulating and maintaining a best practice set of guidelines/principals covering all frameworks and languages employed to deliver a solution [product, automation and integrations].
  Used both Serverless Framework and SAM. I use several IDEs, dependant on task/requirement, mainly VSCode, Rider, PyCharm and VS.
  These are samples of use cases where I have employed Serverless technologies: Websites (ASP.</description>
