      <description>For me, CX (Customer Experience) is paramount. Even if there is an outage, the CX doesnâ€™t have to suffer. In my current project, there are key AWS services, as well as the CXcoach product, that are required to be running for the application to function. I have architected both full systems and application features in such a way for them not to fail because of transient outages or worse and furthermore to provide instant feedback to users.</description>

      <description>The 3 pillars of observability (logging, metrics and tracing) presents new challenges for serverless solutions.
Having experienced this first hand, I set about looking for a solution that will enable rapid root cause analysis to ultimately greatly reduce or even better, mitigate [think runbooks] known undesirable scenarios.
  I believe in positive Customer Experience (CX) and apply this philosophy across everything I do.
I spent time with Datadog [a few months of meetings] discussing ways to help this serverless space to improve observability.</description>
