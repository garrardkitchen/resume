      <description>These are some of the areas where I have dedicated my efforts when it comes to security:
 All vital and IPR associated systems are protected via MFA Grandular IAM permissions configured for AWS services, users and roles I always adhere to the Least Privilege Principle Web Application Firewall (OWASP) Web application XSS, SQL Injection, encoding, securing cookies, role &amp;amp; claims based authz I always encrypt data at rest and also when in transit I always encrypt systems credentials (including 3rd party&amp;rsquo;s) and always include extra layer of encryption All passwords are hashed To isolated blast radius of environments by separating dev/test &amp;amp; prod into different accounts.</description>
