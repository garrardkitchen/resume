      <description>Liaised with a vendor to create conduit [data connector] between our products and theirs. Worked with many vendors including Twilio (including Flex), Zendesk, Telax, DataVoice, Novo, Comways, Altitude, Dubber, Frequentis, Spitch, Amazon Connect, Redbox.
  Worked with teams to scope requirements, define every stage up to sign off and team responsibilities. Each integration would start with a technical presentation delivered by me. This would encompass architecture, stages and responsibilities, establishing test environments and training requirements.</description>
