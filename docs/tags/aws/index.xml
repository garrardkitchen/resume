      <description>The Coach product started as an on-prem application, installed behind the firewall on a single server.
A partner made a request for the product [Coach] to be made highly available. Initially the product was hosted via an active/passive configuration. This was superseded by a load balanced active/active configuration through the application of Akka.NET throughout all components. This enabled an application cluster that could load balance the demands across all components.</description>
