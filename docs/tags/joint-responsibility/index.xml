      <description> It is important to me to ensure throughout all my teams we all document, share and have joint responsibility in maintaining guidelines and best practices. It begins when research starts and continues through the projects lifecycle. Documents are maintained in order to provide guidance to both junior and senior team members. Always stress the importance of consistency and standards.  </description>
