      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Used mainly static content and ported new copy/layout to SAM Serverless Application C# .NET Core Razor Pages solution. Originally WP was in place, so removing MySQL reduced the cost. I created a CI/CD Pipeline using BitBucket.  It is now hosted via API Gateway &amp;amp; Lambda and not via an Azure Website.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Coach product started as an on-prem application, installed behind the firewall on a single server.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A partner made a request for the product [Coach] to be made highly available.  Initially the product was hosted via an active/passive configuration.  This was superseded by a load balanced active/active configuration through the application of Akka.NET throughout all components. This enabled an application cluster that could load balance the demands across all components.  Based on specific feedback, I later re-architected the messaging driven solution and replaced Akka.NET with NATS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
