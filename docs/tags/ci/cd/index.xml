      <description> Used mainly static content and ported new copy/layout to SAM Serverless Application C# .NET Core Razor Pages solution. Originally WP was in place, so removing MySQL reduced the cost. I created a CI/CD Pipeline using BitBucket. It is now hosted via API Gateway &amp;amp; Lambda and not via an Azure Website. </description>

      <description>The Coach product started as an on-prem application, installed behind the firewall on a single server.
A partner made a request for the product [Coach] to be made highly available. Initially the product was hosted via an active/passive configuration. This was superseded by a load balanced active/active configuration through the application of Akka.NET throughout all components. This enabled an application cluster that could load balance the demands across all components.</description>
