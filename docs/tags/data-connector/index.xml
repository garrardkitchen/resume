      <description>I created a process for others, external to the company, to perform integrations. The concept is simple and still used today.
In summary, a conduit known as a Data Connector was developed to (a) be used by Coach via a RESTful API and (b) integrate with Vendor or other system(s) APIs or data sources. Metadata for users &amp;amp; recordings could then be exchanged via the Data Connector. Additional [configurable] data was also passed along this pipeline.</description>
