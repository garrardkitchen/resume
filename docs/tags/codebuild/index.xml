      <description>CI has been a long term development responsibility.
Formally, for our client/server product, I would install and host TeamCity on office servers. Currently for a specific version of Coach, it is now hosted on an Azure instance. The deployment package is delivered to S3 and at the appropriate time (major/minor/patch release) is added to a Confluence site for our customers to download.
All projects are now driven by CI/CD principals.</description>
