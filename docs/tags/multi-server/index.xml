      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Coach product started as an on-prem application, installed behind the firewall on a single server.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A partner made a request for the product [Coach] to be made highly available.  Initially the product was hosted via an active/passive configuration.  This was superseded by a load balanced active/active configuration through the application of Akka.NET throughout all components. This enabled an application cluster that could load balance the demands across all components.  Based on specific feedback, I later re-architected the messaging driven solution and replaced Akka.NET with NATS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
