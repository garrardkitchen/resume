      <description>The product, Coach, was in the first wave of SMEs to integrate with the Amazon Connect product. As part of a team, I met with and coordinated with both the AC team and the Marketplace Team. I developed the QuickStart that is hosted via AWS and produced an AMI that is being marketed in the AWS Marketplace. The Coach product was developed to work with Active Directory and I assisted in creating materials to help with all facets of the QuickStart.</description>
