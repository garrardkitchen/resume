      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The product, Coach, was in the first wave of SMEs to integrate with the Amazon Connect product.  As part of a team, I met with and coordinated with both the AC team and the Marketplace Team.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I developed the QuickStart that is hosted via AWS and produced an AMI that is being marketed in the AWS Marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Coach product was developed to work with Active Directory and I assisted in creating materials to help with all facets of the QuickStart.  It was during this process that I was awarded my first &lt;strong&gt;AWS Certification - Developer Associate&lt;/strong&gt;.  I worked closely with several members of the AC and Marketplace teams. The QuickStart is a nested stack of CloudFormation [Configuration as Code] templates, incorporating both the AWS VPC and the Data Streaming QuickStarts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;QuickStart: &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/connect/qualtrak-evaluate/&#34;&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/connect/qualtrak-evaluate/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Liaised with a vendor to create conduit [data connector] between our products and theirs. Worked with many vendors including Twilio (including Flex), Zendesk, Telax, DataVoice, Novo, Comways, Altitude, Dubber, Frequentis, Spitch, Amazon Connect, Redbox.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Worked with teams to scope requirements, define every stage up to sign off and team responsibilities.&#xA;Each integration would start with a technical presentation delivered by me. This would encompass architecture, stages and responsibilities, establishing test environments and training requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
