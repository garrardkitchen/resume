      <description>Coach has a long standing feature called IntelliSearch.
It is a feature that, at a specific time, for several set periods [daily, weekly, monthly, custom], it will submit queries to a Data Connector (conduit between our system and an external system) to match up randomly selected recordings for later evaluation. The random algorithm implemented is there to ensure fairness of recording selection so apples and apples are compared and not apples to oranges.</description>

      <description>For me, CX (Customer Experience) is paramount. Even if there is an outage, the CX doesnâ€™t have to suffer. In my current project, there are key AWS services, as well as the CXcoach product, that are required to be running for the application to function. I have architected both full systems and application features in such a way for them not to fail because of transient outages or worse and furthermore to provide instant feedback to users.</description>
