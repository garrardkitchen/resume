For the last 10+ years I've been a CTO for an exciting start-up. Recently that came to an abrupt and sad end. I will blog about the days and the efforts involved to keep the company afloat in the comming months and only when rawness of this fades.  Great team, great vision, great imagination.

Today is a new start for me, day 1 if you will.  With very little notice I have compiled this site to present the best side of me in order to become employed again.  I do have a strategy and oddly excited by this forced challenge.  I do not know what is around the corner for me.  Thankfully, I have a lot to offer.  I was exposed to everything a company has to do so this self-believe is not arrogance.  Only time will tell whether or not what I believe is a marketable set of skills.  If you have had the opportunity to working for a start-up then you will know the vast experience and contribution you give across the entire business.  I do hope my futures includes the challenge and excitment that this presents.
