For the last 10+ years I've been a CTO for an exciting start-up. Recently that came to an abrupt and sad end. I will blog about the days and the efforts involved to keep the company afloat in the comming months when it becomes less raw for me.  Great team, great vision, great imagination.

Today is a new start, day 1 as it were.  With very little notice I have compiled this site to present the best side of me to the working world in order to become employed again.  I do have a strategy with a few edge cases in the mix and I am excited.  Who knows what's around the corner for me.  I do know one thing, I have a lot to offer.  Please do not be mistaken, this is not arrogance.  Only time will tell whether what I believe is a great and useful set of skills or not.  One of the best things working for a start-up is the vast array of experience and contribution you get to make across the entire business.
