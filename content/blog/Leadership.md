In summary, good engineering practices look like this:

_This list is not exhaustive, here are a few things I have included:_
- `communication` Share Technical road maps, progress & changes
- `management` Documented Roles & Responsibilities of all team members
- `communication` Share documentation that includes - business domain, systems and their decomposition (think microservices), repositories and dependency, documentation failures, Runbooks (what to do if a scenario presents itself)

- `communication` Happy stakeholders
- `communication` Happy Engineers
- `communication` Engineer development path (this will include, but not limited to, [Good Engineering - Principles](/blog/principles))
- `communication` Engineer days
- `communication` Roles & responsibilities - know your sphere of engagement and this will help mitigate any blockers  
- `communication` Openness to share knowledge and information
- `communication` Regular updates on roadmap and changes. This includes the stakeholder's vision

- `communication` Keep connected (especially important when working with distribution teams)
- `communication` A common approach to working

- `communication` To feel managed so regular contact with line manager is a must. At least one 1-2-1 session each week.  Line Manager must be accessible and approachable.

- `trust` Assign responsibility - most rewarding experience when you are completely responsible for something; give a little bit of your heart and soul into it. Pride
- `trust` Encourage SME
- `communication` Teams must be aligned with core business capabilities (think Conway's Law)

- `trust` Assign ownership, allow team members to flourish 
- `communication` Capture guiding principles to help frame problem space and to help keep focus in the ensuing sprints

_I drill down into more detail in the sections below about some of the bullet points above._
