What is mentoring?

Camille Fournier talks about Mentoring in her book: **The Manager's Path**.  She writes:

    "The first act of people management for many engineers is often unofficial."

This has always been true for me.  My current positions is as a Principal Engineer.  Before this, A CTO.  I've never conducted an official mentoring programme/scheme.  It's just been something that I do, without fuss but with purpose.  

These are the scenarios in which I've mentored others:
 - onboarding a new company starters, 
 - onboarding a new company at a similar level as myself 
 - onbording a graduate (their first job since graduating from university)
 - when working on a project together

I have developed as well as coordinated the  onboarding programme that I developed.  All this was carried out remotely.  This is more relevant today as of the current climate of working from home

Some of the above has been done remotely, including mentoring somebody whom wasn't working for the company at this time.  More on this later.

What follows is a bullet list of key areas that as a mentor you need to be very mindful of:
- clearly communicate what the process is to the mentee
- always listen
- take the time to explain reasons for decisions 
- explain why something is not applicable in that instance 
- don't dismiss anything without a reason as to why you're dismissing it
- allow for mistakes but always follow up with a post mortem. Making a mistake as well as allowing for mistakes to be made is critical for the engineer's development
- make aa safe environment for your mentee to operate in
- make time but be clear about the amount of time you can give (you will have other responsibilities and by doing this, you will inadvertantly force them into make decisions and standing on their own two feet, which again, is a critical for their development)
- work an a real project, something that matters. By limiting the hypotheticals, they get hands-on non-fabricated, warts and all, engineerings experience


I find though that, although there's a prescribed time for mentoring others, think 1-to-1 time, as a person who's lead development and architecture and been key to enabling a direction through technology, I'm always in mentoring mode.  I am always thinking and acting on ways to improve and to do things correctly (think good engineering principles).  You do have to be considerate in the approach to take to deliver this guidance.  My current role of Principal Engineer luckily, affords me this duty. 
 

Encourage people by:
 - by getting up there, in front of everbody
 - whitebording
 - having a voice
 - guiding principles

Always mentoring:
 - git PR review, look at entire file
 - release with tests, even when not a new feature and just a code change
 
One of the most humbling times in my life was when I mentored a colleague who no fault of his own was temporarily let from the employment of the company I was a CTO for.  We were struggling revenue wise and had to slim down the work force. It was a sh*t time. It was important from a personal point of view that I didn't just leave him.  After all, the plan was always to bring him back onboard once things improved.  And they did.  But during the time that it wasn't so great, I would meetup regularly online with him. We would discuss many topics, life, technology, side projects.  Where I could I'd provide guidance and be a sounding board.  From time to time I would lay out things for him to do and the next time we meet up I'd review and provide feedback.  Like I say, it was a very humbling experience as after all, I was still in gameful employment and so at some level it must have been a bitter pill.  We no longer work together but he remains a friend and we do stil often catch up.


outcome:
 - Changes/improvements can be subtle
