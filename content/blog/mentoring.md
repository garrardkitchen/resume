What is mentoring?

In her book  **The Manager's Path**, Camille Fournier talks about Mentoring. She writes:

    "The first act of people management for many engineers is often unofficial."

This has always been the case for me too.  I am currently employed as Principal Engineer, before this, A CTO.  In this time, I have never organised or carried out an official [backed by an recognised authority] mentoring scheme.  It's just been something that I do, without fuss but with purpose.  

This is a list of scenarios where I have mentored others:
 - onboarding a new company starters, 
 - onboarding a new company at a similar level as myself 
 - onbording a graduate (their first job since graduating from university)
 - when working on a project together

Oddly, I have never been a mentee. If I had then there is a possibility that this in itself may have defined this process more for me.

I have created and coordinated an onboarding programme.  This was when I was a CTO.  All this was choregraphed remotely.  Ironically, this is more relevant today than ever.  As I write this CV-19 has started to take a grip of the UK and yesterday I heard of the sad news that 2 people had died from it in Southport where I have now resided since 2008.

This is bullet list of key 'things' that I have discovered that have helped me through the mentoring process:
- clearly communicate what the process of mentoring is to the mentee
- listen first, then respond. Every exhange, learning outcome, question is different
- take the time to explain the rational for your decision 
- take the time to explain why something is not applicable in that particular instance 
- allow for mistakes and always follow them up with a post mortem. We all make mistakes, in some cases, it helps define you. Making a mistake is critical for our development and this is why the next point is important...
- ensure you make a safe environment for your mentee to operate in
- make time but be clear about the amount of time you can give. You will have other responsibilities. Inadvertantly, you are forcing the mentee make decisions. This often encourages the mentee and gives them confidence to standing on their own two feet.  This too is critical for their development
- work an a real project, albeit, scaled back for safety and to limit blast radius.  It has to be something that matters to the business.  This will help the mentee be recognised by their good work. By limiting the hypotheticals, the mentee will then get their hands on a non-fabricated, warts and all, real life engineering problem.


I find though that, although there's a prescribed time for mentoring others, not  1-2-1s - this is something completely different - as a person who has lead both architecture and engineering effort, this has been key to enabling the strategic direction of business, I have always been in mentoring mode.  I am always thinking and acting on ways to improve and to do things correctly (think good engineering principles).  You do have to be considerate in the approach to take to deliver this guidance.  My current role of Principal Engineer luckily, affords me this duty. 
 

Encourage people by:
 - by getting up there, in front of everbody
 - whitebording
 - having a voice
 - guiding principles

Always mentoring:
 - git PR review, look at entire file
 - release with tests, even when not a new feature and just a code change
 
One of the most humbling times in my life was when I mentored a colleague who no fault of his own was temporarily let from the employment of the company I was a CTO for.  We were struggling revenue wise and had to slim down the work force. It was a sh*t time. It was important from a personal point of view that I didn't just leave him.  After all, the plan was always to bring him back onboard once things improved.  And they did.  But during the time that it wasn't so great, I would meetup regularly online with him. We would discuss many topics, life, technology, side projects.  Where I could I'd provide guidance and be a sounding board.  From time to time I would lay out things for him to do and the next time we meet up I'd review and provide feedback.  Like I say, it was a very humbling experience as after all, I was still in gameful employment and so at some level it must have been a bitter pill.  We no longer work together but he remains a friend and we do stil often catch up.


outcome:
 - Changes/improvements can be subtle
