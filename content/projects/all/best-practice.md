- It is important to me to ensure throughout all my teams we all document, share and have joint responsibility in maintaining guidelines and best practices.  
- It begins when research starts and continues through the projects lifecycle. Documents are maintained in order to provide guidance to both junior and senior team members.  
- Always stress the importance of consistency and standards.
