This section lists my experience from some of the projects and initiatives I have lead.  The format is short, in note form and bullet points.

### Carfinance247 projects/activities:

- I have delivered brown bags on AWS serverless services and Google serverless options (*Cloud Functions & Cloud Run Knative, deployed via GitHub Actions*)
- I have delivered a brown bag on Microservices Architecture
- I have delivered a Town Hall, show-casing a solution that uses Twilio Serverless Functions, Twilio Flow, GitHub Actions and other cloud-based services.  This presentation included a slide deck encompassing guiding principles, architecture, the technology used, culminated with a live demo  
- I have helped maintain enterprise Twilio CRM using angular 1.x and supporting HTTP API microservices hosted & load balanced in docker Swarm
- I worked on a Pilot project that assessed both Google and Azure Cloud services. Some of this work, especially story spikes, required pair programming
- I have created a solution that subscribed to Azure Event Grid and Azure Service Bus (*topics & queues*) and used Azure SignalR Service to update a UI hosted on AKS
- I worked on the new Vehicles team, helped shape development principals and used Jenkins and Google services including GKE
- I am working with the Phoenix & Integration team to help maintain and add features to several .NET Core C# and UI git repositories
- I have created equivalent EDA in AWS (*node.js, Serverless, SQS, SignalR, ASP.NET Core*) from PoC written/architected using Google services in a fraction of the time plus architected the solution to deal with edge/corner cases using architecture instead of code
- I have created Bamboo build & deployment projects, as well as Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines
- I have created as part of the GitHub/Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, .NET Core WebApplicationFactory based functional tests that span multiple docker services
- I researched and deployed (docker) Snyk for checking for code/library vulnerabilities, code quality and docker image scanning
- I have participated in multiple inceptions, helped shape HLA and define requirements
- I drew on observability experience to (a) implement/deploy Prometheus time series Db for use with (b) new Grafana dashboards (based on google's USE & RED methods) to help monitor both infrastructure and application performance
- I am architecting a solution that uses GitHub GraphQL to provide better visibility on repository dependencies
- I educate, provide guidance, insight and assist colleagues across multiple teams
- I called on load/stress testing experience to assess HTTP API demand limitations and help identify and fix defects
- I am an active participant in sprints and a strong advocate of Agile (Scrum) & XP development in general
- I have worked on side projects and experimental work for DoE
- I have worked on a PoC project using Azure services (*CosmosDB MongoDB API, Azure Functions, Event Grid, Service Bus, DevOps*)
- I have architected and created a PoC, that uses Twilio Serverless, Twilio Flow, Azure Service Bus Topics, Azure CosmosDB, Azure Storage, Azure Functions all provisioned using Terraform and GitHub Actions that (1) send SMSs to applicants that prompt for answers to a list of questions and (2) providing a summary of questions and answers when the applicant sends a text with 'STATUS' 
- I have architected, managed and developed a project that utilised Twilio Serverless Functions, Twilio Flow and Azure services to orchestrate the queuing of a transferred call to tiered agents (Twilio Workflow Routing Step), dropping the call down through tiers of agents to be answered, including those agents who weren't available originally.  All events uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, then to be processed by an ETL pipeline using Azure Functions and Pandas to find their eventual resting place within an Azure Data Lake for reporting purposes.
