These are some of the areas where I have dedicated my efforts when it comes to security:

- All vital and IPR associated systems are protected via MFA
- Grandular IAM permissions configured for AWS services, users and roles
- I always adhere to the Least Privilege Principle
- Web Application Firewall (OWASP)
- Web application XSS, SQL Injection, encoding, securing cookies, role & claims based authz
- I always encrypt data at rest and also when in transit
- I always encrypt systems credentials (including 3rd party's) and always include extra layer of encryption
- All passwords are hashed
- To isolated blast radius of environments by separating dev/test & prod into different accounts. I restricted account user access in production
- When I need to share a password, I do it via keybase and I never accompanied it with username or other identifiable key.
- I use a password manager & where appropriate share credentials via this route (avoids colleague writing down and exposing during demo)
- I never show passwords via a communication platform (slack, skype, ...)
- If I use wifi, I use vyprvpn
- I educate my colleagues on the above actions & preventitive measures
