- Liaised with a vendor to create conduit [data connector] between our products and theirs. Worked with many vendors including Twilio (including Flex), Zendesk, Telax, DataVoice, Novo, Comways, Altitude, Dubber, Frequentis, Spitch, Amazon Connect, Redbox.  

- Worked with teams to scope requirements, define every stage up to sign off and team responsibilities. 
Each integration would start with a technical presentation delivered by me. This would encompass architecture, stages and responsibilities, establishing test environments and training requirements.
