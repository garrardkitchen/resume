- The product, Coach, was in the first wave of SMEs to integrate with the Amazon Connect product.  As part of a team, I met with and coordinated with both the AC team and the Marketplace Team.  
- I developed the QuickStart that is hosted via AWS and produced an AMI that is being marketed in the AWS Marketplace.  
- The Coach product was developed to work with Active Directory and I assisted in creating materials to help with all facets of the QuickStart.  It was during this process that I was awarded my first **AWS Certification - Developer Associate**.  I worked closely with several members of the AC and Marketplace teams. The QuickStart is a nested stack of CloudFormation [Configuration as Code] templates, incorporating both the AWS VPC and the Data Streaming QuickStarts.
