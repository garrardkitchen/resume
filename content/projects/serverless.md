- Investigated ways to reduce time to market, end-client license costs, hosting costs and development costs.  

    This research and later development efforts contributed to formulating and maintaining a best practice set of guidelines/principals covering all frameworks and languages employed to deliver a solution [product, automation and integrations].  
- Used both Serverless Framework and SAM.  I use several IDEs, dependant on task/requirement, mainly VSCode, Rider, PyCharm and VS.  
- These are samples of use cases where I have employed Serverless technologies: Websites (ASP.NET Core Razor), major features (utilising full AWS stack), automation (set log retention via CLoudWatch Events, set Log subscription, Set API Gateway Key and store in SSM).
- Contribute to Serverless Slack when I can.
