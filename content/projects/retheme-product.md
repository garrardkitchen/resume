- The CXcoach cloud based product needed a ‘face lift’.  

    I investigated the most frugal way to provide the product with a new look and feel, one that is aligned with industry expectations.  I settled on an open source theme and provided my UX lead developer a branch of code that used this new theme for him to complete and fix any style and placement issues.  For specific areas of the product (features), I provided the same person with a mock up (HTML and style) for him to incorporate into the React front-end. 

- I was a front-end developer previously and felt confident that what I had proposed could be implemented within an accepted deadline
