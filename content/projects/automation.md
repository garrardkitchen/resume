- Serverless is ideal for so many use cases.  Automation is a prime example of where serverless technology can fit so well.  
- I have used Lambdas and supporting services to help automating both mundane and configuration tasks.  
    Some examples of these are; setting log retention durations on log group creations, log subscription and adding API Gateway API keys to SSM Parameter Store.
