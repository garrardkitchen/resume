- I have designed and implemented several billing mechanisms.  
- Including designs/models orientated around licensing, another using AWS MMS (metering service) for the AWS QuickStart and more recently, one to capture product usage based on a specific frequency.  The later architectured and delivered once again via serverless technology.
- Created web apps [some serverless] to provide visibility into usage
- Create application features to help mitigate restrictions on internet access
- Subscription models designed and developed for: per agent, per user, per period, per feature usage, per role
