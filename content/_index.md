*Current position:* **Head of Cloud Platform** @ [Carfinance247](http://www.carfinance247.co.uk)

At Carfinance 247, our infrastructure and hosting platforms is legacy. To stabilize the real-estate of amassed web applications, APIs (some microservices, mostly coarse-grained RESTful services), and workers, I am spearheading this digital transformation effort - guided in part by the Azure Cloud Adaption Framework.  I am no stranger to the cloud.  I have been **Cloud First**, and a **Serverless advocate** for many years on both the Azure and AWS cloud platforms.  I have a passion for cloud-native, twelve-factor apps, patterns, and standards, and how their huge impact on the enterprise and small business.  I feel the most comfortable when working with cloud providers.

This effort has lead me to creating our new platform using AKS clusters.  I have designed our CICD strategy to modernize our legacy .NET Framework, .NET Core and NodeJS workloads and to deploy them to Azure cloud.  To compliment this, I have architected a Hub&Spoke topology so we can securely access resources behind private endpoints from our corporate network, and resolve DNS names between Azure and our own on-prem DCs.   

This is a list of technology and backing services I am pioneering here at CF247, as well as using on a day to day bases as well as being responsible for:

- AKS
- Helm
- Azure Bicep
- GHA Workflows
- AzDevOps
- Azure Private Endpoints, Private DNS Zones
- Azure Functions, Event Hub, Event Grid (System & Custom), Service Bus, Storage (inc. Queue, Table, Files), LogicApps, App Services, 
- Security Centre, Defender
- Azure Blueprints
- Azure Policy
- Logz (grafana, kibana) - researched and introduced, replacing our legacy unstable ELK stack
- Azure Application Insights & Monitor, Kusto QL
- Managed Identity
- AAD
- Responsible for Azure
- C#, .net 3.1 & 6, .net framework 4.8
- Steering MS FastTrak programmes including SQL Server AG migration
- Cloud Architecture
- Cloudflare & API v4
- Managing a small but senior team

*Previous position:* **Principal Engineer** @ [Carfinance247](http://www.carfinance247.co.uk)

[Click here to see projects worked on while at Carfinance247](#projects)

I report directly to the DoE (Director of Engineering). I work across teams to educate, assist & advise. I also contribute to the active sprint. I work on side projects and PoC (proof of concept) projects. I have delivered brown bags on both AWS & Google Serverless services. I help to shape HLA, improve coding quality and engineering standards. I am a team player and help support my colleagues and CF247 operations whenever the opportunity arises. I provide direction and guidance on matters relating to cloud computing, architecting and developing for the cloud. I am cloud-first, a polyglot, and an advocate of serverless technologies.

Having researched and implement several projects using the NestJS NodeJS framework, I gave a technical talk in Manchester - meetup - on NestJS framework, Dapr and KEDA in November 2020.

*Previous position:* **Chief Technology Officer** @ [Qualtrak](http://www.qualtrak.com)

[Click here to see projects worked on while at Qualtrak Solutions](#projects)

I have spent the last 10+ years building a development team and helping to shape the company's direction.  Over this time I have embedded an Agile approach to delivering features across multiple products, driven CI/CD initiatives and made the space necessary for the Technical department’s europe-wide development team to be productive, engaged and committed.

*Other positions:* **BI contractor** & **.NET contractor**

Previously working as a contractor in the Business Intelligence space, I have worked for GE Capital, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Equitas & GUS.  

Following University I worked my way to a position of personal interest, known at the time as EIS (Executive information systems).  This propelled me into the BI space where I took the plunge into the contracting world.  Since this time, I have pursued another passion; web application development.  I took a number of small appointments and opportunities to help fine-tune my skills.  With this route, I built up a greater repertoire of skills and abilities to benefit employers.  I have had a number of interesting roles which lead me into my previous role of a lifetime; CTO.  

---

During the last 12 years+ I have become a SME (subject matter expert) in the contact centre space, a seasoned systems integrator, a cloud solutions architect, an experienced serverless developer, a DevOps Evangelist and a technical voice and advisor for Qualtrak, working with teams around the world from all sizes of companies.

### Where I see my passions and the skills to offer a company and my willingness to keep on learning and evolving

- **I can help you migrate enterprise solutions and web applications to the serverless stack (reduce maintenance and running costs) as well as help you rapidly test Hypotheses by developed & deploying new features to assess traction and revenue opportunities** 
- One of my passions lies in serverless technologies.  It has been for some time.  It started with Azure functions a few years back then migrated towards AWS.  The benefits of this approach outweighed any other approach experienced by me in my time in the industry.  Some of my favourite benefits are (1) rapidness from concept to implementation, (2) cost [to you and your customers], (3) SRP [reuse; patterns], (4) isolated scaling and resilience and (5) apportioning the right amount of effort on the business logic and not the infrastructure.  
- I was granted a few weeks to research ML & AI and present it to the Upper Management last year.  
ML is something that, coming from a big data background, was exciting and a place I knew where I wanted to spend most of my time.  I realised that as soon as I started my research into ML, that I was hooked and wholeheartedly fascinated by it.  I have started studying for the AWS Machine Learning Speciality certification.
- I have designed solutions that take advantage of ML services (AWS Transcribe, AWS Comprehend) and have developed PoCs using serverless technology (lambda, step functions, API Gateway).
- I have rarely had the opportunity to contribute to OSS.  This, hopefully, will change. With my experience of developing products and solutions, OSS has been pivotal to their success. As soon as the opportunities arises, I will start paying that back
- I regularly update and complete personal research on the developing world of security and serverless technologies.

I have captured most of my career timeline here in the [Projects](#projects), [Skills](#skills) and [Experience](#experience) sections.
