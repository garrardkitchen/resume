Garrard has spent the last 10+ years building a development team and shaping the company's direction.  Over this time he has implemented an Agile approach to delivering features across multiple products, driven CI/CD initiatives and made the space necessary for his europe-wide development team to be productive, engaged and committed.  

Previously a contractor in the Business Intelligence space, he has worked for GE Capital, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Equitas & GUS.  Following university Garrard worked his way to a position of personal interest to him, known at the time as building and supporting EIS (Executive information systems).  This propelled him into the BI space where he took the plunge into the Contracting world.  Since this time, he pursued another passion; web application development.  He took a number of small gigs to help him fine tune his new skill.  This enabled him to offer more and more to his prospective employers.  He had a number of interesting roles which lead him into his most recent role of a lifetime; CTO.  

During this time he became SME in the Contact Centre space, system integrations, Cloud solutions architect (AWS & Azure),  serverless solutions (AWS & Azure) and both the technical voice and advisor for Qualtrak working with world-wide teams.

**My ideal job will include architecting and implementing serverless solutions supported by ML with a team of passionate and commited professionals delivering features and enhancements for Product Owners.**

Garrard has captured most of his career timeline here in the [Projects] (#projects), [Skills] (#skills) and [Experience] (#experience) sections.
