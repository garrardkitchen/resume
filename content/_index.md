## Previous positions

**Head of Cloud Platform** @ [Carfinance247](http://www.carfinance247.co.uk)

I am leading the digital transformation of Carfinance 247, where our infrastructure and hosting platforms are outdated. I am using the Azure Cloud Adaption Framework to help modernize our web applications, APIs (some microservices, mostly coarse-grained RESTful services), and workers. I have a lot of experience and enthusiasm for the cloud. I have always followed a **Cloud First** and **Serverless** approach on both the Azure and AWS cloud platforms. I am passionate about cloud-native, twelve-factor apps, patterns, standards, and their benefits for the enterprise and small business. I enjoy working with cloud providers the most.

I have created our new platform using AKS clusters as part of the digital transformation effort. I have devised our CICD strategy to update our legacy .NET Framework, .NET Core and NodeJS workloads and to migrate them to the Azure cloud. I have done this while simplifying the process and reducing mental load. To support our new platform, I have designed and built a Hub & Spoke network topology that allows us to securely access resources behind private endpoints from our corporate network, and to resolve DNS names between Azure and our on-prem DCs. I lead a small but experienced team.

These are the technologies and backing services that I am introducing and leading at CF247, as well as working with and managing daily:

- Cloud Architecture
- Azure Administration (Excl AAD)
- AKS
- Helm
- Azure Bicep
- GHA Workflows
- AzDevOps
- Azure Compute, VMSS
- Azure Private Endpoints, Private DNS Zones, Networking and Azure FW
- Azure Functions, Event Hub, Event Grid (System & Custom), Service Bus, Storage (inc. Queue, Table, Files), LogicApps, App Services & Plans, KeyVault, App Configuration, CosmosDB, SaaS (Logz & Kafka), Azure Container Registry
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Advisor
- Azure Blueprints
- Azure Policy
- Azure Application Insights & Monitor, Alerting, Kusto QL
- Logz.io (grafana, kibana) - researched and integrated, replacing our legacy unstable ELK stack
- Azure Managed Identity (.NET & NodeJS SDKs, System & User)
- RBAC
- C#, .net 3.1 & 6, .net framework 4.8
- Steering MS FastTrak programmes including SQL Server AG migration
- Cloudflare & API v4 (DNS, Monitors, Pools and LBs)

### Previous position

**Principal Engineer** @ [Carfinance247](http://www.carfinance247.co.uk)

[Click here to see projects worked on while at Carfinance247](#projects)

Reporting directly to the DoE (Director of Engineering), I collaborate with different teams to teach, support and advise them. I also participate in the current sprint. I work on side projects and PoC (proof of concept) projects. I have given presentations on AWS & Google Serverless services. I help to define HLA, enhance coding quality and engineering standards. I am a team player and assist my colleagues and CF247 operations whenever needed. I offer direction and guidance on cloud computing, cloud architecture and development. I am cloud-first, a polyglot, and a supporter of serverless technologies.

After doing research and implementation on several projects using the NestJS NodeJS framework, I delivered a technical talk in Manchester - meetup - on the NestJS framework, Dapr and KEDA in November 2020.

### Previous position

**Chief Technology Officer** @ [Qualtrak](http://www.qualtrak.com)

[Click here to see projects worked on while at Qualtrak Solutions](#projects)

For over a decade, I have led a development team and contributed to the company’s vision. During this period, I have implemented an Agile methodology to deliver features for various products, spearheaded CI/CD projects and created an environment that enables the Technical department’s European development team to work efficiently, passionately and collaboratively.

During my time here, I developed and had publshed an AWS Quickstart [AWS Quickstart](https://github.com/qualtrak/connect-integration-qualtrak-evaluate) and had a product available in the AWS Marketplace [AWS Evalute for Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-7dhd7dpeuvolc) that integrated with [AWS Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/).

### Other positions

**BI contractor** & **.NET contractor**

As a contractor in the Business Intelligence space, I have gained valuable experience working with GE Capital, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Equitas & GUS.

After graduating from University, I pursued my interest in EIS (Executive information systems), which led me to the BI field and the world of contracting. Along the way, I developed another passion: web application development. I took on various projects and challenges to hone my skills. This enabled me to acquire a wide range of competencies and expertise to offer to employers. I have enjoyed many interesting roles, culminating in my dream job as CTO.

For more than 12 years, I have been a SME (subject matter expert) in the contact centre space, a skilled systems integrator, a cloud solutions architect, a proficient serverless developer, a DevOps Advocate and a trusted technical consultant for Qualtrak, working with teams of all sizes across the globe.

## Where I see my passions, and skill set, benefiting your organisation

- I love learning new things and staying up to date with the latest technologies
- I can guide you and your team through the migration of enterprise solutions and web-based applications to the serverless stack (saving you time, money, and resources) or containerization [App Servces, ACA and AKS], as well as help you quickly experiment with new ideas by developing and deploying features to measure customer feedback and revenue potential
- I am passionate about serverless technologies and have been using them for years. I started with Azure functions and then explored AWS, before coming back to Azure. I believe that serverless is the best way to build modern applications for many reasons, such as:

  - Speed from idea to execution
  - Cost-effectiveness for you and your customers
  - Reusability and scalability of components and events
  - Resilience and isolation of functions
  - Reduced environmental impact and carbon footprint
  - Focus on the business logic and not the infrastructure

- I have hands-on experience in designing and implementing cloud architectures of various scales that ensure business continuity and scalability
- I have leveraged ML backend services (AWS Transcribe, AWS Comprehend) to design solutions and have built PoCs and production services using serverless technology (Azure Functions, LogicApps, Event Grid, Event Hub, AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, AWS API Gateway)
- I have architected and implemented a new platform that uses Kubernetes (AKS) as its core
- I have a strong background in AWS and certifications, but now I am fully committed to the Azure cloud platform
- I keep researching and learning about the evolving world of serverless technologies. My current interest is WASM (OOB) and this has led me to learn Rust.

## My preferred role

To tackle complex cloud-native (CN) architecture (Azure) chalenges and spearhead the CN design and implementation, develop cloud-centric or hybrid solutions, foster a DevSecOps culture, practices and tooling, mentor and shape communities and train teams on cloud skills, and drive innovation through the use of cloud technology.
