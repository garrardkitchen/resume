*Current position:* **Cloud Native Lead** @ [Fujitsu](http://www.fujitsu.com)

---


*Previous position:* **Head of Cloud Platform** @ [Carfinance247](http://www.carfinance247.co.uk)

At Carfinance 247, our infrastructure and hosting platforms are legacy. To stabilize the real-estate of amassed web applications, APIs (some microservices, mostly coarse-grained RESTful services), and workers, I am spearheading this digital transformation effort - guided in part by the Azure Cloud Adaption Framework.  I am no stranger when it comes to the cloud.  I have been **Cloud First**, and a **Serverless advocate** for many years on both the Azure and AWS cloud platforms.  I have a passion for cloud-native, twelve-factor apps, patterns, standards, and their huge impact on the enterprise and small business.  I feel the most comfortable when working with cloud providers.

This effort has lead me to creating, using AKS clusters, our new platform.  I have designed our CICD strategy to modernize our legacy .NET Framework, .NET Core and NodeJS workloads and to deploy them to the Azure cloud.  All this, while keeping complexity to a minimum and avoiding cognitive overload.  To compliment our new plaform, I have architected and implemented a Hub & Spoke network topology so we can securely access resources that are behind private endpoints from our corporate network, and resolve DNS names between Azure and our own on-prem DCs. I manage a small but senior team. 

This is a list of technologies and backing services I am pioneering here at CF247, as well as using on a day to day basis and responsible for:

- Cloud Architecture
- Azure Administration (Excl AAD)
- AKS
- Helm
- Azure Bicep
- GHA Workflows
- AzDevOps
- Azure Compute, VMSS
- Azure Private Endpoints, Private DNS Zones, Networking and Azure FW
- Azure Functions, Event Hub, Event Grid (System & Custom), Service Bus, Storage (inc. Queue, Table, Files), LogicApps, App Services & Plans, KeyVault, App Configuration, CosmosDB, SaaS (Logz & Kafka), Azure Container Registry
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Advisor
- Azure Blueprints
- Azure Policy
- Azure Application Insights & Monitor, Alerting, Kusto QL
- Logz.io (grafana, kibana) - researched and integrated, replacing our legacy unstable ELK stack
- Azure Managed Identity (.NET & NodeJS SDKs, System & User)
- RBAC
- C#, .net 3.1 & 6, .net framework 4.8
- Steering MS FastTrak programmes including SQL Server AG migration
- Cloudflare & API v4 (DNS, Monitors, Pools and LBs)

*Previous position:* **Principal Engineer** @ [Carfinance247](http://www.carfinance247.co.uk)

[Click here to see projects worked on while at Carfinance247](#projects)

I report directly to the DoE (Director of Engineering). I work across teams to educate, assist & advise. I also contribute to the active sprint. I work on side projects and PoC (proof of concept) projects. I have delivered brown bags on both AWS & Google Serverless services. I help to shape HLA, improve coding quality and engineering standards. I am a team player and help support my colleagues and CF247 operations whenever the opportunity arises. I provide direction and guidance on matters relating to cloud computing, architecting and developing for the cloud. I am cloud-first, a polyglot, and an advocate of serverless technologies.

Having researched and implemented several projects using the NestJS NodeJS framework, I gave a technical talk in Manchester - meetup - on the NestJS framework, Dapr and KEDA in November 2020.

*Previous position:* **Chief Technology Officer** @ [Qualtrak](http://www.qualtrak.com)

[Click here to see projects worked on while at Qualtrak Solutions](#projects)

I have spent the last 10+ years building a development team and helping to shape the company's direction.  Over this time I have embedded an Agile approach to delivering features across multiple products, driven CI/CD initiatives and made the space necessary for the Technical department’s Europe-wide development team to be productive, engaged and committed. 

During my time here, I developed and had publshed an AWS Quickstart [AWS Quickstart](https://github.com/qualtrak/connect-integration-qualtrak-evaluate) and had a product available in the AWS Marketplace [AWS Evalute for Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-7dhd7dpeuvolc) that integrated with [AWS Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/).

*Other positions:* **BI contractor** & **.NET contractor**

Previously working as a contractor in the Business Intelligence space, I have worked for GE Capital, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Equitas & GUS.  

Following University I worked my way to a position of personal interest, known at the time as EIS (Executive information systems).  This propelled me into the BI space where I took the plunge into the contracting world.  Since this time, I have pursued another passion; web application development.  I took a number of small appointments and opportunities to help fine-tune my skills.  With this route, I built up a greater repertoire of skills and abilities to benefit employers.  I have had a number of interesting roles which lead me into my previous role of a lifetime; CTO.  

During the last 12 years+ I have become a SME (subject matter expert) in the contact centre space, a seasoned systems integrator, a cloud solutions architect, an experienced serverless developer, a DevOps Evangelist and a technical voice and advisor for Qualtrak, working with teams around the world from all sizes of companies.

### Where I see my passions, and skill set, benefiting your organisation

- My thirst for learning is the catalyst that drives and keeps me current
- I can help you migrate enterprise solutions and web-based applications to the serverless stack (reduce maintenance and running costs) as well as help you rapidly test hypotheses by developing & deploying new features to assess traction and revenue opportunities 
- A passion (one of many!) is serverless technologies.  It has been for many years.  It started with Azure functions a few years back, progressing this experience with AWS, returning over the last few years to Azure.  IMO, the benefits of Serverless outweigh any other approach experienced by me in my time in the industry. These are some of my favourite benefits from adopting serverless technologies: (1) rapidness from concept to implementation, (2) cost [to you and your customers], (3) SRP [reuse; patterns], (4) isolated scaling and resilience and (5) apportioning the right amount of effort on the business logic and not the infrastructure.  
- My experience as well as being responsible for the design of and implementation of (very hands-on), cloud architectures of different sizes that deliver on business continuity and scalability.  
- I have designed solutions that take advantage of ML backend services (AWS Transcribe, AWS Comprehend) and have developed PoCs and production services using serverless technology (Azure Functions, LogicApps, Event Grid, Event Hub, AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, AWS API Gateway).
- Architected, and am currently implementing a new Platform that has Kubernetes firmly at it's heart
- Although I have a track record with AWS, as well as certifications, my focus now is firmly on the Azure cloud platform. 
- I keep current and research the developing world of serverless technologies.

### My preferred role

To lead the design and implementation of cloud-native architecture (Azure), development of either cloud-centric (or hybrid) products or services, guided by DevOps culture, to help shape the patterns and practices used and to innovation through the application of cloud technology.
