*Previous position:* **Chief Technology Officer** @ [Qualtrak](http://www.qualtrak.com)

I have spent the last 10+ years building a development team and helping to shape the company's direction.  Over this time I have embedded an Agile approach to delivering features across multiple products, driven CI/CD initiatives and made the space necessary for the Technical department’s  Europe-wide development team to be productive, engaged and committed.

*Other positions:* **BI contractor** & **.NET contractor**

Previously working as a contractor in the Business Intelligence space, I have worked for GE Capital, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Equitas & GUS.  

Following University I worked my way to a position of personal interest, known at the time as EIS (Executive information systems).  This propelled me into the BI space where I took the plunge into the contracting world.  Since this time, I have pursued another passion; web application development.  I took a number of small appointments and opportunities to help fine tune my skills.  This enabled me to offer a greater repertoire of skills and abilities to prospective employers.  I have had a number of interesting roles which lead me into my previous role of a lifetime; CTO.  

---

During the last 12 years+ I have become a SME (subject matter expert) in the contact centre space, a seasoned systems integrator, a cloud solutions architect, an experienced serverless developer, a DevOps Evangelist and a technical voice and advisor for Qualtrak, working with teams around the world from all sizes of companies.

### Where I see my passions and the skills to offer a company and my willingness to keep on learning and evolving

- **I can help you migrate enterprise solutions and web applications to the serverless stack (reduce maintenance and running costs) as well as help you rapidly test Hypotheses by developed & deploying new features to assess traction and revenue opportunities** 
- One of my passions lies in serverless technologies.  It has been for some time.  It started with Azure functions a few years back then migrated towards AWS.  The benefits of this approach outweighed any other approach experienced by me in my time in the industry.  Some of my favourite benefits are (1) rapidness from concept to implementation, (2) cost [to you and your customers], (3) SRP [reuse; patterns], (4) isolated scaling and resilience and (5) apportioning the right amount of effort on the business logic and not the infrasture.  
- I was granted a few weeks to research ML & AI and present it to the Upper Management last year.  
ML is something that, coming from a big data background, was exciting and a place I knew where I wanted to spend most of my time.  I realised that as soon as I started my research into ML, that I was hooked and wholeheartedly fascinated by it.  I have started studying for the AWS Machine Learning Speciality certification.
- I have designed solutions that take advantage of ML services (AWS Transcribe, AWS Comprehend) and have developed PoCs using serverless technology (lambda, step functions, API Gateway).
- I have rarely had the opportunity to contribute to OSS.  This, hopefully, will change. With my experience of developing products and solutions, OSS has been pivotal to their success. As soon as the opportunities arises, I will start paying that back
- I regularly update and complete personal research on the developing world of security and serverless technologies.

I have captured most of my career timeline here in the [Projects](#projects), [Skills](#skills) and [Experience](#experience) sections.
