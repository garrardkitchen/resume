I have spent the last 10+ years building a development team and helping to shape the company's direction.  Over this time I have embedded an Agile approach to delivering features across multiple products, driven CI/CD initiatives and made the space necessary for his europe-wide development team to be productive, engaged and committed.  

Previously a contractor in the Business Intelligence space, I have worked for GE Capital, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Equitas & GUS.  Following university I worked my way to a position of personal interest, known at the time as building and supporting EIS (Executive information systems).  This propelled me into the BI space where I took the plunge into the contracting world.  Since this time, I have pursued another passion; web application development.  I took a number of small gigs to help fine tune my skills.  This enabled me to offer a greater repertoire of skills and abillities to prospective employers.  I had a number of interesting roles which lead me into my most recent role of a lifetime; CTO.  

During this time I became SME (subject matter expert) in the contact centre space, system integrations, cloud solutions architecture (AWS),  serverless solutions (AWS) and was both the technical voice and advisor for Qualtrak, working with teams around the world.

### Where I see my passion and the skills to offer a company

- One of my passions lies in serverless technologies.  It has been for some time.  It started with Azure functions a few years back then migrated to AWS.  The benefits of this approach outweighed any other approach experienced by me in my time in the industry.  Some of my favourite benefits are (1) rapidness from concept to implementation, (2) cost [to you and your customers], (3) SRP [reuse; patterns], (4) isolated scaling and resilience and (5) apportioning the right amount of effort on the business logic and not the infrasture.  
- I was granted a few weeks to research ML & AI and present it to the Upper Management last year.  
ML is something that, coming from a big data background, was exciting and a place I knew where I wanted to spend most of my time.  I realised that as soon as I started my research into ML, that I was hooked and wholeheartedly fascinated by it.  I have started studying for the AWS Machine Learning Speciality certification.
- I have designed solutions that take advantage of ML services (AWS Transcribe, AWS Comprehend) and have developed PoCs using serverless technology (lambda, step functions, API Gateway).
